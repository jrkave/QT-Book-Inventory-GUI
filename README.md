# QT-Book-Inventory-GUI
This project uses QT Creator to make a GUI for a simple Book Inventory application.
Its features include: login functionality (using md5 for simple password encryption), modification of the book inventory (using QSql), pseudo-purchasing of books, and adding or changing users (stored in a .csv file).
It also includes the option to display information about a user's hardware to the screen.
